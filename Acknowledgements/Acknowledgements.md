# Acknowledgments

I would like to thank everyone who supported me throughout the creation of this book. I also want to thank myself—for persevering despite immense resistance. Ceaser, you are truly amazing.

First, I thank Qolarbear, who has always been my steadfast supporter. He meticulously typed out the early drafts of this book line by line into a Word document.  
Through our many conversations—whether at McDonald’s, in parks, or in the countryside—I gained invaluable insights. In fact, these dialogues have been a vital channel for mutual learning between us.

Second, I thank my brothers who inspired me. We’ve all learned so much from one another. They are:  
- Comet  
- Araf  
- Atix  
- Nexus  
- Monkey (who is from Egypt; I’ve lost contact with him for a long time)  
- Siyu Wen  

Third, I thank the friends who have consistently accompanied and encouraged me. Among them, Zhang Lixing (ZLX) and I have known each other since I was four years old. They are:  
- Zhang Lixing  
- Tang Ziqing  
- Natwd (Benny Liu)  
- Deng Yunze  
- Zhouyan Ghengrui  
- Teng Pengfei  

I created a photo album webpage for the original The Origin team to document every significant memory we shared. The link is as follows:  

Without your encouragement and companionship, completing this book would have been as difficult as scaling a mountain.

Fourth, I thank the people closest to me—my parents. To be honest, they didn’t help me with this project (and may have even been a source of resistance), but I still want to thank them.  
I remain deeply grateful that they fulfilled their responsibilities as parents and always gave me the best they could. Thank you—you’ve worked hard.

Fifth, I thank the books I’ve read.  
You’ve probably encountered stories like this before: someone who, as a child, loved reading so much that books felt like gold. I don’t know if you’ve ever been obsessed with books yourself, or whether you believe such tales—but for me, books have truly been my second teacher. I stand on the shoulders of giants.  
I can’t recall every single book that inspired me, but their influence on me has undoubtedly been profound—whether I agreed or disagreed with their ideas. Without them, this book wouldn’t exist. These include:  
- *Human Compatible*  
- *Life 3.0*  
- *Good Economics for Hard Times*  
- *Poor Economics*  
- *Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid*  
- *Why Nations Fail*  
- *The Silk Roads*  
- *Makers*  
- *Out of Control*  
- *The Inevitable*  
- *The World Until Yesterday*  
- *Collapse*  
... and many more.

Finally, I thank you—for gifting your priceless time to this book. This is my first book, and I hope you enjoy it.
