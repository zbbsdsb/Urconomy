# Book Proposal: Urconomy – How to Deal with the Godamn Era  
**Author:** Ceaser Zhao  

Dear MIT Press Editors,

I am Ceaser Zhao, a high school student from China. I am writing to propose my new book, **Urconomy**, for publication with MIT Press.

At its core, *Urconomy* asks: In this era of unprecedented transformation in human history, how do we refocus our perspective onto the individual? Economics is no longer the domain of scholars puffing pipes in secluded rooms—it belongs to everyone. Each of us becomes an observer of this world.

### Why MIT Press?

MIT has always stood out for its boldness, intellectual courage, and sense of responsibility. To many—including me—MIT Press is nothing short of a totem. The first MIT Press book I ever read was *Deep Learning*. I still cannot put into words the awe and joy I felt turning its pages.

I also note your recent publication of *The Embodied Mind: Cognitive Science and Human Experience* (https://direct.mit.edu/books/monograph/4061/The-Embodied-MindCognitive-Science-and-Human), which deeply resonates with the philosophical and cognitive themes in my work.

### About Me

I am Ceaser Zhao—a high school student from mainland China, though I prefer to call myself a **dreamer**. I am utterly fascinated by the world itself and profoundly in love with existence.  

If someone asked me to define myself, I would resist. Labeling others is a cognitive shortcut—it reduces mental load by categorizing people—but why should I label *myself*? While many books encourage us to “go beyond labels,” isn’t it better to avoid labeling altogether?  

If forced, I would call myself a **dreamer**—not a high school student, developer, or linguist (though I wouldn’t write that on a job application, haha). I believe defining people through societal narratives erases their humanity.

I hold deep reverence—not just for life, but for the qualities it manifests in this world. I often imagine a deeper connection between us and reality. The boundary between order and chaos is not only how our brains function best—it is also a profoundly wise social philosophy.

I firmly believe that **chaos theory**, now confined to Navier-Stokes equations in physics-based renderers, will soon become common knowledge among the general public. As the AI wave surges, each of us must examine ourselves. Only by understanding chaos can we grasp our own complexity.

This is where figures like Max Tegmark—brilliant physicists—fall into a **competence trap**: their mastery of physics leads them to flawed conclusions about humanity’s future. (This topic is explored in depth in Chapter 4.)

*Urconomy* does not lecture—it invites readers on an exploration, peeling back layers of our present world and possible futures.

The chapters vary in cohesion:  
- Chapters 5 and 6 are loosely integrated; each subsection reads like an independent essay.  
- Chapters 4 (on AI) and 7 (on the Metaverse)—once hyped together, now largely separated—are tightly woven epics. These are the most romantic chapters of the book. My goal while writing them was to make readers exclaim: *“Wow—this is absolutely mind-blowing!”*

### Proposal Details

#### Unique Selling Points:
1. I offer a fresh perspective—not just as a Gen Z voice, but as someone navigating intense academic pressure in a traditional Chinese high school while maintaining a sense of alienation and wonder.
2. No existing book hands the agency of interpreting our rapidly evolving world directly to the reader.
3. Most economics books either project forward from the present or look backward to warn the future. *Urconomy* refuses prediction (which I consider foolish). Instead, we focus on **the present** and what **will inevitably happen**—a mindset captured in my longtime motto: *“As always.”*

#### Target Audience:
Curious, dream-driven individuals of any age who possess both imagination and the will to act.

#### Competitive Landscape:
*Urconomy* complements four major works:

| Dimension | *The Coming Wave* | *Out of Control* | *Capital in the Twenty-First Century* | *Life 3.0* |
|----------|-------------------|------------------|----------------------------------------|------------|
| Focus | Tech diffusion & governance crisis | Self-organization & emergence | Wealth inequality | AI & human destiny |
| Attitude | Caution + call for control | Optimistic + embrace emergence | Critical + institutional reform | Prudent + proactive design |
| Core Metaphor | Tsunami-like wave | Hive / Chameleon | Snowballing capital | OS upgrade for life |
| Solution | Tech brakes + global regulation | Decentralization + open ecosystems | Global wealth tax | AI alignment + value embedding |

- Compared to *The Coming Wave*, *Urconomy* focuses more on AI’s societal impact through philosophical and cognitive science lenses, rather than government intervention.
- Relative to *Out of Control*, *Urconomy* (especially Chapters 3, 7, 9) grounds Kevin Kelly’s visionary ideas in today’s reality—less speculative, more grounded (since *Out of Control* is now decades old).
- Chapters 5, 6, and 8 of *Urconomy* revisit and update the questions raised in *Capital in the Twenty-First Century*, incorporating new technologies and opportunities over a decade later.
- While I deeply admire Max Tegmark (*Life 3.0*)—a physicist I greatly respect (and who appeared on Lex Fridman’s podcast)—his book is somewhat dated and overly pessimistic in parts. *Urconomy* offers a more balanced, human-centered view.

#### Manuscript Status:
- **Total Word Count**: ~91,000 Chinese characters (original draft)
- **Completion**: 70% complete
- **Expected Completion**: April 2026
- **Sample Chapters Attached**:  
  - Chapter 1: *The Pipe in the Room* (introductory chapter)  
  - Section 6.2 from Chapter 6: *Acceptance* (on China’s rise and social challenges)

### Chapter Summaries

#### 1. The Pipe in the Room  
Economics suffers from deep misunderstanding—it’s seen as mystical or elitist. But it should be a fresh lens, accessible to all, not divorced from everyday life.

#### 2. Painting Ads on Car Doors  
A decade ago, we entered “Sharing 1.0.” Now, it’s time to rethink everything. Some things being free once seemed impossible—yet other things can never be replaced by “free.”

#### 3. Antiques  
Those who collected early IBM mainframes were hopeless tech enthusiasts. Today, owning a 3D printer might make you a hero to future geeks.

#### 4. What Will They Take Away?  
When ChatGPT emerged, I asked: “What will they take?” Answer: If we act together, they’ll take nothing—and instead usher in humanity’s greatest golden age. But first, we must solve urgent problems.

#### 5. Sunrise on Another Continent  
Imagine living in extreme poverty in a parallel universe. (If you’re reading this, you likely don’t worry about survival.) Poverty isn’t the only blind spot—we also deeply misunderstand people of different ages, limiting society’s potential.

#### 6. In the East  
The 19th century belonged to Britain, the 20th to America—the 21st is Asia’s, especially the Far East. Some nations sprint forward; others recover from crisis. All are becoming forces the world cannot ignore.

#### 7. Dreammakers  
The metaverse lies quietly in its coffin—but we will one day split it open with the hardest axe. Sitting atop Mount Teide in Tenerife at sunset, we may doubt whether reality is just a Markov process fixed since the Big Bang. But that doesn’t matter. Topics once deemed untouchable—free will, the nature of the virtual—may soon force us to confront the essence of existence.

#### 8. Crossing the Sea of Magma  
We hate alarmism—yet the current world order *is* crumbling. Every nation faces unique crises and must find its niche in a new global ecology. Dangerous for individuals, yes—but for humanity, perhaps a rare opportunity: a springboard to a better world.

#### 9. From Today On, It’s the Godamn Era  
Every book changes you. This one will too. When tomorrow’s sunlight enters your room, you’ll begin a new day—and this book will become your past, and your asset. Embrace this era as the protagonist. Tell your story. It’s called the **Godamn Era**.
