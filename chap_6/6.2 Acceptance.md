# 6.2 Acceptance  
## ——————— When the “Impossible” Becomes the Norm

Every so often, someone—sometimes even highly respected scholars—insists that China’s economy is on the verge of collapse. Yet time and again, they have been proven wrong.

For example:

- **1990s**: State-owned enterprise reforms, mass layoffs—“This country is finished.”  
- **2008**: Global financial crisis, foreign trade collapse—“This country is finished.”  
- **2015**: Stock market circuit breakers, capital flight—“This country is finished.”  
- **2020s**: Real estate bubble, aging population—“This time it’s really over.”

Their fundamental error? Applying static models to a dynamic system. Such models inevitably fail at the national scale. Even a small Balkan nation involves countless variables—let alone China, a country of over a billion people.

> *(Zooming in: In China, many parents treat their children as predictable machines rather than complex living systems. I know this statement will infuriate some parents—but unfortunately, they can’t refute it. The evidence is overwhelming, though most aren’t even aware of it. We’ll explore in Chapter 8 why Chinese parents exhibit such disproportionately high cognitive biases toward their children compared to other regions.)*

Western economists prescribed standardized “remedies” for Eastern Europe and Latin America. China, by contrast, chose an atypical path—“crossing the river by feeling the stones.” We won’t declare one approach superior, but we can observe China’s current state:

Aside from aging—which remains a serious challenge—China has not only resolved the earlier crises but done so remarkably well.

We won’t cite GDP or CPI figures, nor detail national-level miracles. If you follow politics, you likely already see China as the world’s greatest variable. If you don’t, data won’t sway you anyway. So here’s a concise assessment of China’s strength:

> In the future, China will irreversibly establish strategic dominance in critical fields like artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and space exploration through technological self-reliance and industrial advantage. Its energy, digital, and manufacturing systems will fuse into a global infrastructure and tech ecosystem that the world cannot bypass. Faced with containment, China neither argues nor retreats—it advances through strength alone.  
>  
> We all understand: it’s not that China needs validation—it’s that the world must learn to accept an ascending, undeniable Eastern power.

I know these words may be dismissed as blind patriotism—but I’m merely stating facts.

People tend to develop political interest as they mature—not because they genuinely care about politics, but because they grow dissatisfied with reality. At that stage, they eagerly seek out negative news about their own country and share it with classmates. In middle school, political classes still felt like tales of peaceful prosperity. But by high school, the mood darkens.

Whenever teachers recite formulaic political slogans—“Ten Upholds,” “Two Centenary Goals,” “Targeted Poverty Alleviation”—whispers ripple through the classroom, followed by bursts of laughter. Many students believe the state is performing theater, deceiving them with grand narratives to mask harsh realities. Others spin elaborate conspiracy theories.

Yet a moment of reflection dismantles these views: yes, serious problems exist in China; yes, the interests of ordinary citizens are sometimes sacrificed. But these are necessities—not deliberate neglect. No government can achieve the perfection it proclaims, yet China *is* making consistent efforts. Living standards *have* improved. China *has* crossed the chasm of mid-tier manufacturing and now holds strong positions in many cutting-edge fields.

When the government says, “Concentrating resources to accomplish major tasks is a systemic advantage,” you might suspect deception—but history has validated this claim at the national level. In a sense, this is a form of trickle-down: you’re strapped onto the nation’s chariot. Once the period of acute pain passes, national gains will eventually reach you too.

The core insight? **You are a person—but the government is not an individual; it’s a system.** Personifying the state distorts your judgment: you amplify its flaws when it errs and assume ill intent in every new action. This bias is inevitable.

After all, China operates under a one-party framework, which requires a grand narrative of national rejuvenation—supported by rapid economic growth, which in turn demands forceful policies that inevitably harm many. It’s a “better short pain than long suffering” strategy. We can’t morally judge it, but macroscopically, it’s an advantage few other nations possess.

Recall Africa’s independence wave in the 1960s: for many new nations, their best era was *immediately after independence*—because immense challenges lay ahead.

Imagine building a house under strict constraints: limited materials, fixed deadlines, restricted room layouts. Each nation’s blueprint differs—but most African states inherited foundations of sand. Forget skyscrapers; even digging a pit risked collapse.

China, by contrast, was so thoroughly devastated—economically, politically, infrastructurally—that total reconstruction became possible. Crucially, while Africa lacked managerial talent, China had legions of grassroots cadres (the Communist Party prioritized local leadership during revolution). This created extraordinary national cohesion, enabling China to smash through barriers continuously.

A solid foundation also allowed long-term planning without fear of disruption. Any opposing forces were simply no match for the Party. This yielded unexpected benefits—like infrastructure.

Setting aside political motives behind China’s infrastructure boom, consider its *economic spillover effects*. “Spillover” here operates across multiple dimensions: spatial, industrial, institutional…

Most importantly, infrastructure expands the nation’s **“possibility space.”** It doesn’t just raise the baseline—it may unlock unforeseen potential in future domains we can’t yet imagine.  
*(The AI-driven electricity surge of 2025 is already hinting at this.)*

Now, let’s shift perspective—from the Chinese public’s view to a god’s-eye view of China’s actions:

China isn’t running a fixed institutional system. It’s building a **“Social Operating System”** capable of dynamically rewriting its own rules. Its core competency? **“Institutional hot-swapping”**—modifying底层 code (policies, laws, property rights, tech standards) *without shutting down the system* (i.e., without triggering collapse), continuously adapting to external shifts.

More precisely, China has created a national-scale **“isolation chamber,”** allowing its machinery to operate *counter-cyclically*—against global economic and political cycles. Domestically, people complain of economic gloom—but they also acknowledge remarkable stability.

Whether this ultimately helps or hinders China’s potential is debatable. But for ordinary citizens, it’s undeniably fortunate. People need a reasonably reliable national roadmap—not Russian roulette-style policy swings—to confidently plan their lives, careers, and futures at city, provincial, and national levels.

> *(That said, average happiness in China remains relatively low—a topic we’ll unpack in Chapter 8.)*

Of course, China faces deep structural issues—not surface-level wounds, but ingrained mindsets that suppress national potential.

Here, we must address China’s much-criticized education system. Going forward, we’ll refer to East Asia’s high-pressure, deeply interconnected model as **Eastamos**.

Frankly, I dread revisiting this topic. My views on Chinese education evolved dramatically from elementary through high school:

### **Elementary School**  
In third grade, I dreamed of working at Google—thanks to Google Earth. (This was pre-Gemini, pre-DeepMind breakthroughs.) Back then, I had no strong opinion on China’s education system. My first shift came in fifth grade: I began questioning the practical value of what we learned. But since elementary content demanded little time, I wasn’t resentful—just indifferent. Those years passed smoothly.

### **Sixth Grade (Second Shift)**  
Our district starts junior high in sixth grade. I became a full-blown cynic—criticizing China’s GDP metrics, Olympic athletes, British politics, and especially the education system. For the first time, I *loathed* what I was taught—not knowledge itself, but its emptiness and repetition. Homework felt nauseating.

I idolized Bezos, Musk, and Zuckerberg, mistakenly attributing their success to dropping out. But *result ≠ cause*. They dropped out because they knew their purpose. My view of Chinese education was profoundly naive.

### **Grades 7–9 (Third Shift)**  
My perspective shifted again. I grasped China’s immense civilizational weight—and realized judging its education system through an individual lens was meaningless. Later, books validated my thoughts, thrilling me. Perhaps information overload immersed me in a grand-narrative illusion. Around then, “involution” entered mainstream discourse.

I used to scoff: *“If you’re going to act, at least act convincingly! Without changing core institutions or social norms, these reforms just feed shadow education industries!”*  
But I was still immature. The government isn’t performing theater—it has clear objectives, and those goals haven’t been met yet.

Yet hidden within this system are severe disadvantages for ordinary people—or at least, missed opportunities for improvement.

Consider two regions: **Beijing** (political/educational epicenter) and **Sichuan** (strategic hinterland, neither rich nor poor). From a utilitarian view—where “success” means admission to elite universities—Sichuan represents one of the most painful categories: lacking both the abundant resources of developed areas *and* the policy support granted to underdeveloped ones.

Let’s call such places **semi-developed regions**.

Before college, students here already face steep odds. Their **educational redundancy**—useless, exam-focused content designed purely for selection—is far higher than in developed areas. Why? Because China’s resources are vastly insufficient relative to its population. Developed regions, with richer educational endowments, can afford lower redundancy and invest more in holistic education—precisely what semi-developed students need most. Thus, they pay a “birth tax” for their geography.

And after college? The gap widens. Better teachers, stronger school management, and mature critical thinking give developed-region students a massive edge in navigating university life and bridging information asymmetries. For semi-developed students, breaking these barriers is extraordinarily difficult.

So whether before or after college, they’re at a disadvantage. **Involution isn’t choice—it’s forced short-termism.**

China’s aging crisis intensifies this. Those born five years before me and five years after—roughly a ten-year cohort—bear peak societal pressure. In 5–6 years, college applicants will plummet—but demand won’t follow. Society doesn’t need 600,000 AI engineers. Competition will remain white-hot. The system persists.

> *“I couldn’t outcompete others, so I chose something nobody wants.”*  
>  
> This isn’t surrender—it’s strategic redirection. It’s claiming *your* field, not battling in society’s narrow consensus arena against those naturally suited for it.

When friends rant about China’s education system, I usually cut them off. I’m exhausted by the topic: no amount of complaining changes anything. And for yourself? There’s always a better path—don’t let social winds anchor your choices. Honestly, I’d rather you grab me dinner from the cafeteria than vent further. 

But as I’ve insisted all along: **Why can’t we make it better?**  
The **“Macromind Revolution”** (my term for ideological reform) will be detailed in Chapter 8, under the “Rule Systems (Neorowprine)” section. We’ll also rebut claims that “China is making trade impossible” there.

Alright! If we linger here any longer, we’ll drown in this frustrating quagmire. Let your mind revisit these ideas once more—then it’s time to move forward.

Accepting China’s rise is, at its core, accepting the world’s **complexity** and **multipolarity**. A different world is emerging. China—the planet’s greatest variable—is here, regardless of whether you admire, dislike, or despise it.  

Now, it’s time to turn our gaze southward—to South Asia, where a saga rivaling China’s is unfolding.
