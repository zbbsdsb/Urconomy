# 1.2 Everywhere (The Scope of Economics Is About to Expand Dramatically)

## 1.2.1 The Crown

Long ago, I heard about an academic hierarchy of disdain. At the top sit mathematicians, gazing down from the lofty heights of axioms—eternally correct, untouchable. Just beneath them are physicists, who reduce the cosmos to elegant equations. In their worldview, everything is predetermined: from particle collisions to galactic collapses, the future is a blueprint calculable from precise initial conditions.

At the very bottom? Economists and sociologists—frequently wrong, often collectively so.  

A classic example: during her 2008 visit to the London School of Economics (LSE), Queen Elizabeth II bluntly asked, “Why did no one see the crisis coming?” Indeed, in the years before Lehman’s collapse, mainstream economists—including former Fed Chair Alan Greenspan—were immersed in the illusion of the “Great Moderation,” believing that interest-rate tweaks and complex derivatives had tamed economic volatility. (The period from the 1990s to 2004 *was* one of unusually stable growth.)

Even more striking was the saga of LTCM—the “dream team” of the 1990s. Its roster included Nobel laureates and MIT PhDs; they co-invented the famous Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Yet within just four months, this assembly of geniuses lost $4.6 billion and nearly dragged down the global financial system. Why? They ignored the “black swan.” They knew black swans existed—but assumed none would ever fly through their window.

LTCM isn’t just a financial cautionary tale; it’s a profound challenge to the idea that mathematics can conquer markets. It proves that no matter how precise a model is, it cannot replace humility in the face of uncertainty. As Robert Merton later admitted: “We didn’t lose to the market—we lost to our own overconfidence in our models.”

Or consider the recent COVID-19 pandemic—no one foresaw its economic fallout. Economics’ “unreliability” runs deeper: even once-sacred truths get overturned. The Phillips Curve, long considered stable, has faced serious doubt. Many economic “laws” once deemed ironclad have crumbled under changing realities. Even Paul Samuelson—one of the 20th century’s greatest economists—once argued that the Soviet economic model surpassed America’s. Only after the Iron Curtain fell did he recognize Moscow’s policies as absurd and unsustainable.

To ordinary people, such episodes severely damage economics’ credibility. In many eyes, economics remains a deeply unreliable discipline.

## 1.2.2 “The Crusades”

As a child, I naively believed economics taught how to “turn stones into gold”—a shortcut to wealth. I imagined it could predict stock movements, telling me exactly when to buy or sell, as if it held the secret code to fortune. Later, I realized I was utterly mistaken. Most economists aren’t particularly wealthy—in fact, among academics, they’re relatively poor. Their image also defies childhood fantasies: few resemble David Hilbert-style classical scholars; many look more like Silicon Valley startup founders. (Perhaps students in every field do.)

Like all disciplines, economics is rapidly evolving—and its domain is poised for massive expansion.

It’s time to shatter your stereotypes. Let’s introduce three cutting-edge, almost counterintuitive branches of economics:

<div>

1. **Neuroeconomics**:  
   For centuries, economics assumed humans are rational—a famous but increasingly abandoned premise. Today, economists acknowledge our irrationality. Recognizing this may resolve long-standing puzzles (like price stickiness). Neuroeconomics studies how biology shapes decisions.

2. **Algorithmic & Institutional Design**:  
   How should society function? Confucius prized “the Doctrine of the Mean”—not mediocrity, but perfect balance. He claimed he never met someone who truly embodied it. Perhaps that balance is humanity’s ultimate goal. I have no doubt we can turn the AI wave into our greatest opportunity—if we figure out how to share the pie. Future generations may solve it, but only if we work hard now.

3. **Generalized Capital Theory**:  
   What *is* wealth? It evolves with time. In *21 Lessons for the 21st Century*, Yuval Noah Harari argued data is the most valuable asset. But with the AI surge, even that view may soon be outdated.

</div>

Consider a food-delivery platform as an example:

- **Neuroeconomics (desire engineering)**:  
  Red UI buttons, countdown timers for flash deals—they exploit loss aversion and dopamine spikes to trigger orders. This field targets your biological instincts with surgical precision.

- **Algorithmic & Institutional Design (rule-making)**:  
  The dispatch algorithm is a “micro-institution.” It must balance riders, users, and the platform. A well-designed system (with incentive compatibility) motivates riders to work efficiently while improving user experience. A flawed one traps riders in a dystopian loop—like India’s “death deliveries.”

- **Generalized Capital Theory (accumulation & power)**:  
  The platform accumulates not just monetary capital (commissions) but—more crucially—*data capital*: your food preferences, rider routes, traffic patterns. This data becomes the new means of production, granting the platform unprecedented rule-setting power in the digital age.

Thus, economics creates markets where none existed and finds logical exits where hope seems lost. Now, it’s time to redefine her entirely.
