# 1.1 From the End (Patagonian Night, Ushuaia)

At the foot of the mountains, the city has already fallen silent. Tierra del Fuego lies far away.  
The Beagle Channel’s seasonal winds sweep through, carrying glacial chill that whispers between houses with a low hum.  
This is the southernmost tip of the continent—and the beginning of the wilderness.

Thick, lead-gray clouds drift northward from Antarctica, hanging low near the peaks of the Andes. Mountain summits flicker in and out of view within the clouds; above the snowline, snow persists year-round. The range descends through fir forests and exposed rock, while Ushuaia’s houses cluster densely along the slopes.  

The bay’s water is dark and dense, its surface hard like stone, reflecting only faint traces of daylight.  
In this landscape, colors are muted, and the atmosphere feels cold and desolate. Buildings, trees, and distant ships appear tiny against the vastness of sea and mountain. Even without human presence, the clouds, mountains, and ocean would endure.

This is Ushuaia—the southernmost city in the Americas.

You stop in your tracks, gazing at the grand fjord. You know where it leads: northwest to Punta Arenas in Chile, east into the Atlantic. Yet you sense this fjord opens not just to other places—but to another world.

Your eyes follow a ship until it vanishes beyond the horizon. Leaning against the seaside railing, you feel a mix of excitement and dread. You recall an album title:  
“*Nadie Sabe Lo Que Va A Pasar Mañana*” (“No one knows what will happen tomorrow”).  

Indeed—no one knows. Perhaps tomorrow you’ll encounter your own singularity. But you already suspect it won’t arrive as expected. It will slip out of Alice’s rabbit hole when you least anticipate it. That’s the strange feeling: you seem to watch yourself from the outside, observing everything that happens to you as if from a distance.

Back at your hotel, you open a book sent by a classmate from afar—a book you deliberately carried all the way to Ushuaia.  
As you read, you slip into a singular state: you enter a new micro-world. There, you don’t fully possess your senses, yet you feel profound joy. You believe you’ve touched Jung’s collective unconscious in a wholly new way. Images flash before your mind’s eye at dizzying speed.  

When your thoughts return to reality, inspiration strikes.  
“Tomorrow is a brand-new journey,” you write in your notebook.  
You read the sentence again and again, then wash up and go to bed.  
Lying there, you can’t suppress your excitement—but eventually, your eyelids force a shutdown.

In your dream, your mind enters some sacred, private space.  
And your journey begins—from the end of the world.
