- 1.1 from the End (Night in Patagonia, Ushuaia)

At the foot of the mountains, the city has already fallen asleep. In distant Tierra del Fuego, reality intertwines with magic.

The seasonal winds from the Beagle Channel carry the lingering chill of glaciers, weaving through layers of rooftops and emitting a low, mournful howl.

This is the end of the continent—and the prologue to the wilderness.

Heavy leaden clouds roll northward from Antarctica, hanging so low they nearly graze the spine of the Andes. Pale mountain peaks rise and fall amid drifting clouds; above the snowline lies an eternal stillness, cold and unyielding. The mountains descend into forests of fir and exposed rock, where Ushuaia nestles like a cluster of colorful shells abandoned on the shore—pressed tightly into the folds of the hillside.

The water in the bay possesses an almost metallic sheen—deep, icy, reflecting the dim light of the sky.

Ships anchored in the harbor sway gently in the cold wind, their ropes rhythmically slapping against masts in a monotonous, lonely cadence. Far off, a massive cargo vessel slowly disappears from view, its wake quickly erased by dark, rolling waves.

Here, color is subdued, and vitality restrained. All buildings, trees, and distant ships appear insignificant against the grandeur of mountain and sea. There exists a near-divine solitude—as if even if every human vanished, these clouds, these mountains, and this icy water would continue their silent standoff, frozen in rhythm at the edge of time.

This is the end of the world.
